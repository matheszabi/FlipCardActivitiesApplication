# FlipCardActivitiesApplication

At iOS is very easy to create an Flip animation between 2 screens, with a few line of the code.
This example want to be a similar animations.
However it is not 100% copy of the iOS, because that platform has other sizes for the views in the middle of the animations.

In this case there is an Y rotation and a Z translation.
